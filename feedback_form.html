            The Taj Mahal is a white marble built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. In Arabic, the Taj Mahal is known as "crown of palaces". It is said to be the jewel of Islamic art in a nation that is predominantly Hindu.The love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz made a beautiful monument which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

            One of the seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal flanks a garbage-strewn river and is often enveloped by dust and smog from belching smokestacks and vehicles in the northern city of Agra.
            Tiny insects from the drying Yamuna River into which the city pours its sewage crawl into the Taj Mahal, their excrement further staining the marble, an environmental lawyer told Indiaâ€™s Supreme Court.
            polluted Yamuna might be harming the Taj in more than one ways. The white marbles of the Taj Mahal have been stained and fading over the years. A new study suggests that pollution, mainly hydrogen sulphide is the cause for corrosion.

            Aside from scrubbing the Taj clean, recent efforts to save the Taj include building a new dam to help restore the flow of water to the Yamuna river, shutting off some of the 52 discharge pipes pouring waste into the water and improving local sewage treatment plants.
            Let's protect, So our future generation can see this beautiful architecture.
